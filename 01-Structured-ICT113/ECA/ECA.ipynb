    "First feature that improves my program’s maintainability is the Commenting provided.Commenting provided in part a is comprehensive, precise and detailed.<br> This enables any coder who wants to modify my code get the basic understanding of my steps in the code (which enhances the readability of my code ),<br> which ensure that they can amend my code rightfully according to their needs without any errors. This decreases the likelihood of overall potential errors occurring during modification phase making my program more modifiable improving my program overall maintainability.<br>\n",
    "Secondly, by breaking down my main function into sub-functions, modularising my code, this enable accessors of my code to try out the sub-function instead of the entire main function at once.If there is any error made, the error occurred will be directly linked to that sub-function from which accessor can comprehend the genuine factor of why the code broke down, additionally allowing the user to try out that specific function. This also allows users to directly and effectively alter the programs by altering the specific function as per user need. Abstaining from usage of global variables in my functions has also contributed to my program maintainability. Furthermore, I didn’t use wildcard import which also adds on to the improvement of my program maintainability.\n"
